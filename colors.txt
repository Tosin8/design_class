The ultimate guide to color

_______________________________
 Colors can be noted down in different ways, and the most 
common ones you will probably come across are: 
 Pantone, CMYK, HEX, and RGB.

 We only use HEX and RBG in screen design.

Pantone: use for print.
It is an exact mix of ink, so it is the same color globally. 
You cannot print Pantone on your home printer.
 
it is usually more expensive to print Pantone colors 
which is why it is mainly used for logos or brand elements
 that need to match across different media, the rest stays is in
 CMYK.

CMYK → Use for PRINT
 Mixing the four colors, cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black), 
is the base of all other print colors. These are also the four colors
 found in your home printer and professional printshops.

RGB → Use for UI Design
 RGB
RGB stands for red, green, and blue. 
The monitor emits these colors, so they are made of light and not ink.
 The color spectrum of light is larger than print.
 Due to their different systems, print and screen colors will never
 match 100%.

 When giving RGB values in UI design,
 it ranges from 0–255 e.g. R= 255, G =255, B=255
 or RBG=255,255,255 is white while RGB= 0, 0, 0 is black.

 RGBA → Use for UI Design
 Is the same as RGB, the A stands for an additional alpha channel. 
Alpha regulates the transparency from 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).
So for example RGBA = 255, 255, 255, 0.5 would be white with 50% transparency.

Note: Colors in print and screen design will never be perfectly aligned as they are created in 
different ways: print by mixiing ink, screen by combining light.
