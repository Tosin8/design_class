The ultimate guide to color

_______________________________
 Colors can be noted down in different ways, and the most 
common ones you will probably come across are: 
 Pantone, CMYK, HEX, and RGB.

 We only use HEX and RBG in screen design.

Pantone: use for print.
It is an exact mix of ink, so it is the same color globally. 
You cannot print Pantone on your home printer.
 
it is usually more expensive to print Pantone colors 
which is why it is mainly used for logos or brand elements
 that need to match across different media, the rest stays is in
 CMYK.

CMYK → Use for PRINT
 Mixing the four colors, cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black), 
is the base of all other print colors. These are also the four colors
 found in your home printer and professional printshops.

RGB → Use for UI Design
