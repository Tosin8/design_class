 The 7 prototypes: 
* The action button
* Interactive switches
* List item swap action
* Button loader: It's very useful interaction for actions that require loading or wait times for the user.
* Pull to refresh
* Dragging Interaction:  while dragging an item inside an app, there is always something happening with the item itself, Sometimes the item shrinks, maybe other items are blurred, or the opacity changes.
* Multiple 'like' buttons
