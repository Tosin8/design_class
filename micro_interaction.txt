 The 7 prototypes: 
* The action button
* Interactive switches
* List item swap action
* Button loader: It's very useful interaction for actions that require loading or wait times for the user.
* Pull to refresh
* Dragging Interaction:  while dragging an item inside an app, there is always something happening with the item itself, Sometimes the item shrinks, maybe other items are blurred, or the opacity changes.
* Multiple 'like' buttons

Importance of microinteraction in ux

* They boost user retention: creating small moments of delight - 
     These moments all contribute towards improving the user experience and increasing the likelihood that users will keep using the product.
* They create WOW moments and enhance branding - 
     In growth hacking, these moments can also lead a WOW moment, which is the moment which is the point during the onboarding phase when a user establishes that your product is the right fit for them.
* They boost usability and intuitiveness - 
       they are a way of providing the user with constant feedback, by telling them both what the system is doing and letting them know when their actions have been successfully registered by the website or app.

Types of microinteraction

Understanding fundamentals of the microinteraction.

* Tap effects e.g: hearting a tweet on Twitter, Highlighting selected fields on forms
* Swipe effects
* Tap and hold effects e.g: Facebook react feature button. 
* Scroll-into-view
* Pull-to-refresh
* Progress bar
* Errors
* Sound
* Button state changes
* Tactile
* Mouse over / hover effects : Hootsuite magnetic cards, 
* Slide-in/out
* System feedback
* Page transitions (fade, explode, etc)


Best practices for designing microinteractions
______________________________________________
* Define what interaction will take place and how long it will last
* Don’t make a user mouse over an element to reveal more information
* Don’t drown your design in microinteractions
* Remember the differences between desktop and mobile interactions
* Try to keep the mobile and desktop experience as similar as possible

The four parts of microinteraction
_________________________________________
1. Triggers: will the user or the system trigger the microinteraction? 
If it’s the system, what input does it need?

2. Rules: what should happen when the user or system triggers your microinteraction? 
A tap, a click? A mouse over? A scroll?

3. Feedback: use your microinteraction to communicate what’s happening to your user.
 Is the page loading? Is the button clickable? Is there another user sending a message?

4. Loops and Modes: think ahead, should the microinteraction
still be possible after certain conditions have been met?
If a button is greyed out, should it still change color on mouse over?
