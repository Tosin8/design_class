7 Simple Microinteractions to Improve Prototypes.

 The 7 prototypes: 
* The action button
* Interactive switches
* List item swap action
* Button loader: It's very useful interaction for actions that require loading or wait times for the user.
* Pull to refresh
* Dragging Interaction:  while dragging an item inside an app, there is always something happening with the item itself, Sometimes the item shrinks, maybe other items are blurred, or the opacity changes.
* Multiple 'like' buttons

Importance of microinteraction in ux

* They boost user retention: creating small moments of delight - 
     These moments all contribute towards improving the user experience and increasing the likelihood that users will keep using the product.
* They create WOW moments and enhance branding - 
     In growth hacking, these moments can also lead a WOW moment, which is the moment which is the point during the onboarding phase when a user establishes that your product is the right fit for them.
* They boost usability and intuitiveness - 
       they are a way of providing the user with constant feedback, by telling them both what the system is doing and letting them know when their actions have been successfully registered by the website or app.

Types of microinteraction

Understanding fundamentals of the microinteraction.

* Tap effects e.g: hearting a tweet on Twitter, Highlighting selected fields on forms
* Swipe effects
* Tap and hold effects e.g: Facebook react feature button. 
* Scroll-into-view
* Pull-to-refresh
* Progress bar
* Errors
* Sound
* Button state changes
* Tactile
* Mouse over / hover effects : Hootsuite magnetic cards, 
* Slide-in/out
* System feedback
* Page transitions (fade, explode, etc)


Best practices for designing microinteractions
______________________________________________
* Define what interaction will take place and how long it will last
* Don’t make a user mouse over an element to reveal more information
* Don’t drown your design in microinteractions
* Remember the differences between desktop and mobile interactions
* Try to keep the mobile and desktop experience as similar as possible

The four parts of microinteraction
_________________________________________
1. Triggers: will the user or the system trigger the microinteraction? 
If it’s the system, what input does it need?

2. Rules: what should happen when the user or system triggers your microinteraction? 
A tap, a click? A mouse over? A scroll?

3. Feedback: use your microinteraction to communicate what’s happening to your user.
 Is the page loading? Is the button clickable? Is there another user sending a message?

4. Loops and Modes: think ahead, should the microinteraction
still be possible after certain conditions have been met?
If a button is greyed out, should it still change color on mouse over?

 
Push Notification Best Practices: 7 Questions Designers Should Ask
Source: Toptal
___________________________________________________________________
Push notifications are among the most potent tools being used for communicating with users.
When apps send these short messages, they pop up on devices—even with the screen locked—making them almost impossible to ignore.
 
1. Should Your Message Be a Mobile Push Notification—or Something Else?
Considering whether it might be more appropriate to send an email or text instead, 
 * SMS messages are best for time-sensitive or critical information.
 An airline, for instance, should use SMS messages to communicate gate or schedule changes since a mobile push
 would not reach passengers who have notification permissions disabled. 
SMS messages are also better for information that might have to be accessed later, such as an order confirmation, 
since mobile app push notifications are easily cleared with a single tap
and are often unretrievable.

Mobile push notifications are effective for delivering important but non-urgent information, 
such as an announcement about a sale or a request that users agree to new app permissions.

2. Did You Request Permission to Send a Push Notification?
 Many apps ask for permission to send notifications immediately after installation. 
This makes sense if reminders are essential to an app’s user experience—for instance, to be effective, 
habit-tracking apps need to regularly nudge users. But in most cases, it’s actually best to wait to ask
 for permission until someone has used the app a few times and seen the value it provides.

3.Does the Notification Deliver Personalized Value to the User?

 On app onboarding: the two approaches
we can all agree that the design team needs to do everything they can to encourage users to get past the initial learning curve 
and flatten that app abandonment rate.
1. Have a tailored plan : it’s important to treat  app onboarding as another crucial element in the user experience. 
Just like we carry out extensive research on who users are and create an entire design around the user’s mental models and personas, 
we must create an onboarding experience that reflects who the user is.

Types of onboarding
__________________________________
* Benefits oriented onboarding
* Function oriented onboarding
* Progressive onboarding

Factors to consider 
________________________
* Firstly, consider your users. Are they young and tech-savy?
 Are they familiar with the main function of the app? 
You want to understand who they are and how much of an introduction they need in order to obtain
 some benefit from the product.
Another important aspect of users is their expectations.
 You don’t want to bombard them with information, 
but you can’t let the product fall short of expectations.

* Secondly, consider your product. 
Does it have many different features? Is it complex in nature?
How long is the learning curve? Can we shorten that curve?
 You want to showcase the product’s strengths 
and get the user to see the big advantages that are waiting for them at the end of
 the learning process.

2. Tell users how much they have left
Nobody likes waiting. There’s a reason why app onboarding sequences tend to be brief 
and to the point. Users tend to be excited to try a new app for the first time, 
to explore and mess around in their own time.
 Onboarding can be a powerful way to jumpstart that exploration of possibilities, 
but it can’t stretch on for too long – user’s excitement doesn’t last forever.

That’s why we see progress bars in the checkout process of so many platforms.
 Users want to know their progress, and how long the whole onboarding sequence is –
and as designers, we like to please users.

3. Make it casual and interactive
Most people don’t want to be lectured or even attend a class on the brand new app they just downloaded. 
They want to jump straight into the user experience. That’s why it’s always a good idea to lighten the tone
 and turn the introductory class into a conversation. The truly great app onboarding sequences out there take
 this opportunity to add some brand personality, so that the whole thing feels like a simple chat with the app.

4. Know the right moment to ask for things
This is a simple matter that can still arouse strong feelings in users. 
Some people simply don’t like apps bombarding them with requests to grant permissions,
 like push notifications, or personal information, like billing data. When it comes to onboarding, 
there’s such a thing as overstepping.

This is worth remembering when it comes to permissions, grants, sensitive information and even tasks 
that require general effort from users.
 For example, many great apps out there allow users to signup, 
explore and have fun before they start asking for more information 
to complete the user profile.

This is about postponing the things that require either effort of trust,
 giving the user some room to grow more familiar and comfortable with the product and the brand.

The wrap up: 
App onboarding is all about getting users to see the big benefits of having the app and showcasing 
the strongest points of the design. While there’s no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to 
onboarding experiences, there’s a general goal of helping the user get set up and giving them the 
tools to enjoy the experience.
