* Make a storyboard template online using storyboarding software or start with a piece of paper.

    - Choose the aspect ratio: Films are often shot in 16:9, whereas social media videos are often square/9:16 i.e 
    instagram stories. The apsect ratio will dictate the frame image.
   - Keep it rough: scamps are rough by definition, they are for me to see - not the world
   - Keep it moving
   - Consider contiunity
* Edit the storyboard to flesh out the film's most important visual cues such as the time of day for 
a scene, lighting, composition, camera movement and layering.
* NOTE: camera movements for shots such as zooms, pans, tilts, dollies, trucks and pedestals.
