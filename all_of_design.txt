_______________________________________________________________________________

Principles of design are the principles designers make to create appealing work organized and functional way. 

1. Balance - 
It creats stability in a design piece and every elements on a page carries a visual weight it may be 
scales, shapes, colors, textures etc. A lack of balance may make a project to looks like it is falling on one side. 
2. Unity - 
It's an harmony produced in all design element piece, making the elements to create relationship organically as possible. 
3. Contrast - 
It refers to the different level between design elements to create visual hierarchies, helping the viewer to go to certain
elements because they stand out more and it can be used to create a focal point. 
4. Emphasis - 
Its a strategy used to get viewer's attention to a specific design elements and can be used through the use of colors, 
lines and positive,negative relationships. 
Note: The moments contrast is created, emphasis will follow. Lack of emphasis will make it looks dull and boring. 
5. Repetition - 
It's repeting the same elements through a design to create consistency, it can be of the same typeface, same graphics elements or even a 
grid. Repetition is based on single element.
6. Pattern - 
It's a multiple repetition of design elements that will help enhance the viewer's experience of the final design. Patterns are based on 
multiple elements that just expand through. 
7. Rhythm - 
It's the visual tempo of a combination of elements used repeatedly throughout design and with variation , this helps create
movements but it's an organized type of movement. 
8. Harmony - 
It's a sense of cohesiveness between the elements in a design composition, the element in a composition shouldn't be
all the same but it should be somehow related and this can be done through the same color palette similar
typefaces or the same typefaces sometimes and alos similar styles. 
9. Variety - 
It creates contrast and tension in a design composition and it can be intriguing for the viewers, using the 
different shape and typefaces in an element aslong it shows out the concept of the design. 
10. Movement - 
It refers to the path our eyes takes through a design composition
11. Proportion - 
It's the sense of unity created when all of the design elements in a composition relate well to each other and that can 
add balance and harmony. The absence of proportion will make

* Usability heursitics begin with user needs - 
   Before jumping into the set of principles, it must be recognized that the importance of the user continues to grow. 
   Always start with user needs, if i don't know what the user needs, i wouldn't build the right thing. 
   
  Heuristics principles for usability evaluations help identify where a UI design is falling short: 
  1. Transparency of system sturcture - 
      the act of making certain elements and structures visible so the user has a sufficient understanding
      of context. 
  2. Immediacy of action feedback - 
     The response to a user's action that confirms the system 
     has received the request. 

Anticipatory Design:
How to Create Magical User Experiences
______________________________________________________
 Anticipatory design is the UX technique of simplifying processes 
and responding to user needs one step before they actually express those needs,
simplifying user decisions and leading to magical experiences.

It can also be defined as the output, without much need for input.
 It’s about leveraging past choices to predict future decisions.
 Anticipatory design’s promise is the elimination of friction and an increase 
in efficiency that would greatly improve user experiences, and in turn impact 
the bottom line. 
People return to products and services that deliver
 what they want when they want it.

How do we bring anticipatory design into play?

Until we have incredibly sophisticated predictive algorithms, 
fully developed AI, and machine learning, businesses can mine 
existing data for personalization opportunities thereby reducing potential pain 
points and barriers.

* Mobile friendly: making it mobile-compatible. 
* In Scale: a product needs at least one 'in scale' image so people can get a sense of its size.

* Pinch: allowing pinch gestures to zoom in on product images on mobile. 
* Checkout: making checkouts short, the average checkout flow has 15 form fields. 
* Auto-format fields: card number fields should allow spaces 
* Input masks: using localized input masks and other restricted inputs, especially on mobile.
* Thumbnails: showing all product image thumbnails, truncating additional images causes.
* Inline validation: do live inline form validation for transactions. 
* Required/Optional : mark both required and optional fields explicitly for speedy checkouts
* Expiration date: make the expiration date inputs exactly the same format as the credit card
* Ratings summary
